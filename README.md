# Gambling Slots Machine (casino)

## About

This project is a server-side implementation of the "Burning Love" slot machine game, inspired by the original version from [booming-games.com](https://booming-games.com). It replicates the gameâ€™s mechanics, including spins, winning lines, and balance management, without bonus rounds or free spins.
